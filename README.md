# React Offline Test

## TLDR

- Project starts as normal
- Integration tests are using cypress so will need to be ran seperately
- `npm test` to run jest tests

## Running the Project

A simple `npm install` then `npm start` will be fine.

## Unit Tests

`npm test` for jest unit test with react testing library.

# Integration tests

First you will need to start the server, then run the command `npm run cypress:open` to open the cypress window where you can run the spec from.
